            <h3>Elena Koundourou</h3>
            <p>
                Elena Koundourou studied occupational therapy at the Technological Educational Institute of Athens and
                completed her studies at the Karolinska Institute of Stockholm, where she also specialized in
                neurological rehabilitation. From 2000 to 2004 she worked as an external collaborator in a
                rehabilitation center, special therapies offices and home treatments, while at the same time she began
                to specialize in pediatric occupational therapy and even more specifically in autism. From 2005 to 2008
                she was in charge of the occupational therapy department at a large rehabilitation center. In 2005 she
                created the occupational therapy center "Exelixis" which maintains to this day with main interest the
                rehabilitation of neurological and developmental disorders in children. In 2014, the occupational
                therapy center "Exelixis" co-located and permanently collaborated with the Speech and Language Therapy
                Center, thus improving the benefits to its customers. This collaboration developed and matured, as a
                result of which the two centers were united under a new name and the creation of the center for special
                therapies "Simeio". In addition to the above, she is a supervisor of students and graduates of
                occupational therapy, a member of the interdisciplinary team of many kindergartens in Thessaloniki and a
                member of the Panhellenic Association of Occupational Therapists. She also collaborates with the
                Metropolitan College of Thessaloniki, in various roles within the department of occupational therapy,
                such as that of teacher of courses, head teacher of first year and responsible practiceIng. She is
                specialized in Sensory Integration, Vision, PECS and TEEACH methods, Social Histories, Behavior
                Management methods for people with disabilities, Motor Learning, PNF, Functional Tone Management, Animal
                Assisted Therapy, Circus Therapy and many other methods. In 2020 she began her master's degree ( MSc) in
                rehabilitation with a view to neurodevelopmental pediatric rehabilitation at Oxford Brooks University ,
                England. From the beginning of her career until now she has not stopped educating herself so that the
                times do not overtake her and she faces occupational therapy with unquenchable passion, love and
                responsibility.
