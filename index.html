            <h2>Welcome to the Center for Special Treatments "Simeio"</h2>
            <p>
                Four therapists starting from different points (different fields) joined their paths. Driven by
                their love for their fellow man, vision and common values, they fulfilled their dream to create a space
                that promotes the enlightenment of the individual. Our main concern is the respect of each patient and
                his uniqueness, the inclusion of all specialties, the individual and the family in the therapeutic
                journey.

                    or functional. It aims at the development of extra-verbal and verbal communication, the clarity of

                        clothing-shoes safety, movement, personal hygiene.</li>
                    <li>The productivity of the individual where his ability in the field of work is assessed. For the
                        child, "work" is the game and his learning development. </li>
                    <li>The person's mobility, where their ability to coordinate parts of the body (upper and lower
                        limbs)
                        with fine or gross mobility is mainly evaluated.</li>
                    <li>The person's sensory skills where his ability to perceive his body (somatocognition) and how he
                        perceives the body's relationship with the environment (kinaesthesia) is assessed.</li>

                    confirmed special educational needs and with or without disabilities. With special education, an
