            <h3>Welcome to the Center for Special Treatments "Simeio"</h3>
            <p>
                Four therapists starting from different points (different fields) joined their paths. Driven by
                their love for their fellow man, vision and common values, they fulfilled their dream to create a space
                that promotes the enlightenment of the individual. Our main concern is the respect of each patient and
                his uniqueness, the inclusion of all specialties, the individual and the family in the therapeutic
                journey.

            <h3>Speech Therapy</h3>
            <p>
                Speech therapy is the science that has as its subject the study, research and application of
                scientific knowledge about Human Communication (verbal or not), Speech (oral, written) Speech,
                Voice, and their disorders, as well as swallowing and feeding disorders.
                Speech therapy contributes to the improvement of the linguistic, cognitive and communication
                skills of people of all ages who face difficulties that hinder them in daily activities.
                Child development is a normal process of progression from an early and lower level of
                functionality to a more complex one, such as that of adults. Although each child has its own
                rate of language development, there are some linguistic milestones, i.e. "indicators" that serve
                to highlight the level of functioning of the child in relation to the expected levels based on
                his age in various areas of the individual's functionality. . The deviation from these
                milestones may be an indication that we should visit a speech therapist to have an assessment
                done and if required to proceed with the intervention through an individualized treatment
                program.

            <h3>Occupational Therapy Robotics</h3>
            <p>
                Robotics is considered as an innovative activity that begins to enter dynamically and affect the
                educational process. Occupational therapy through robotics is an occupational therapy
                intervention program that uses the activity of robotics as a therapeutic agent. During this
                intervention the child enters the process of building his robot and programming it to do some
                process. The objectives of the program are for the child to increase his construction skills,
                reduce his impulse, develop and improve his executive functions such as problem solving and
                working memory and increase the ability to cooperate. It is aimed at children mainly with
                attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity, with learning difficulties, with
                difficulties in practice skills and with difficulties in social interaction. It is a very
                pleasant way of occupational therapy intervention that motivates children to try harder. Through
                creation, the feeling of fulfillment is created which increases the self-esteem of the child and
                gives quality and satisfaction to his life.

            <h3>Occupational Therapy</h3>
            <p>Occupational therapy" as a term is derived from the words "work" and "therapy". It could be
                defined as therapy through work (activity) but also therapy for work (activity). Occupational
                therapy uses purposeful activity as a means of treatment. At the same time, it is concerned,
                through it, that the individual is able to engage in all the activities that have meaning for
                him adequately. It is a science of rehabilitation where in a holistic way it aims at the
                autonomy and functionality of the individual. Pediatric occupational therapy
                The pediatric field is one of the main fields of occupation of occupational therapists in
                Greece. Play is a very important activity for children and is used therapeutically in
                occupational therapy. The most important purpose of pediatric occupational therapy is the
                successful involvement of children in school activities (such as attendance in the classroom,
                recess, reading at home, etc.), in recreational activities (such as playing on the playground,
                cycling, team building play, family activities, etc.) and autonomy (food, clothing, personal
                hygiene, etc.) according to the typical standards of each age. The above can be achieved either
                by improving some skills of the child that are lacking (such as sensory processing,
                concentration, gross and fine motor skills, visual-motor coordination, self-confidence,
                self-organization, etc.), or by adapting the environment or the activity to level of the child.

            <h3>Parental Counselling</h3>
            <p>
                Parental counseling takes place between the parents and the psychologist / psychotherapist to
                whom they are addressed. Counseling sessions discuss the issues that concern parents in relation
                to their child, family or their own role as parents. These issues may concern issues in a
                child's behavior, emotional difficulties, difficulties in socialization or difficulties faced by
                parents in their own role. Also, in the management of specific situations, such as a death or
                loss in the environment of the child, a serious illness that affects the daily life of the
                family and the child, the divorce of the parents or a traumatic event. Parental counseling
                depending on the situation may be the only intervention or be combined with the psychotherapy of
                the child or adolescent, as well as with other interventions, such as speech therapy and
                occupational therapy in the context of an overall therapeutic program.
                The aim in parental counseling is through the relationship that parents develop with the
                psychologist / psychotherapist to receive support in their role as parents, to get direction
                from the psychologist / psychotherapist in the management of specific issues, not through
                general advice but within a framework that takes into account the needs of the specific family
                and the specific child, to better understand the difficulties that their child may be facing and
                to give space to the development of a common attitude on the part of the parents that favors
                their cooperation.
                Depending on the circumstances, parental counseling may take place with one or both parents and
                the frequency of sessions may vary depending on the needs of the family and the therapist's
                assessment of the treatment program.
