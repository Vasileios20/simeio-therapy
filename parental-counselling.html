            <h3>Parental Counselling</h3>
            <p>Parent counseling takes place between the parents and the psychologist/psychotherapist to whom they
                turn. In the counseling sessions, the issues that concern the parents in relation to their child,
                the family or their own role as parents are discussed. These issues may concern issues in a child's
                behavior, emotional difficulties, difficulties in socialization or difficulties that parents face in
                their own role.
            </p>
            <p>Also, in the management of specific situations, such as a death or a loss in the child's environment,
                a serious illness that affects the daily life of the family and the child, the divorce of the
                parents or a traumatic event. Depending on the situation, parent counseling can be the only
                intervention or combined with the psychotherapy of the child or adolescent, as well as with other
                interventions, such as speech therapy and occupational therapy in the context of a more
                comprehensive therapeutic program.</p>
            <p>The goal in parent counseling is through the relationship that parents develop with the
                psychologist/psychotherapist to receive support in their role as parents, to get direction from the
                psychologist/psychotherapist in terms of managing specific issues, not through general advice but
                through a framework that takes into account the needs of the specific family and the specific child, to
                better understand the difficulties that their child may face and to give space to the development of a
                common attitude on the part of the parents that favors their cooperation.</p>
            <p>Depending on the circumstances, parenting counseling may take place with one or both parents, and the
                frequency of sessions may vary depending on the needs of the family and the therapist's assessment of
                the treatment plan.</p>
