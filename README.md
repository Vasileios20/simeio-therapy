# Simeio Therapy
This project has been developed for the Special Treatments Center "simeio" based in Thessaloniki, Greece. The treatment center aims to inform people, mostly parents, regarding the therapies they apply and encourage parents to seek for help when they discover a problem with their child's speech or movement difficulties. It provides information about the services that the Treatment Center offer, information about the team and a contact form.
