            <h3>Speech Therapy</h3>
            <p> Speech therapy is the science that deals with speech, speaking voice and chewing-swallowing
                disorders in children and adults, whatever the cause of these disorders: neurological, developmental
                or functional. It aims at the development of extra-verbal and verbal communication, the clarity of
                speech and voice and the speech production of the hard of hearing. </p>

            <p> From the age of about eighteen months until the day the child goes to school, he first learns sounds,
                then words, and finally to make sentences. But if he does not learn to speak properly, when he later
                goes to school he will have difficulty writing properly.
                Many of the children who have learning difficulties at school age had speech problems in preschool.
                Fortunately, however, the reverse is not the case: It is not a rule that all children who have
                speech
                problems will also develop learning problems. This is because, when speech problems are detected
                very
                early, they can be overcome relatively easily with the help of a specialist.</p>

            <p> For a parent to understand that their child has a learning problem, they must first join the learning
                process. However, from very early on there may be signs that the child will have difficulties in
                school.
                Already at the age of 2.5 years, unintelligible or difficult to understand speech is a sign that
                should
                concern parents, as it hides a complex phonological disorder that can affect his ability later to
                correctly decode syllables and words containing sounds that he had difficulty to produce earlier.
                Each
                person has their own pace of development. But there are certain time limits that, when exceeded,
                parents
                should seek expert advice.
